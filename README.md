This project was developed for the **Open Databank Ghana Illegal Mining (Galamsey) Data Visualization Hackathon**, a challenge aimed at raising awareness about the devastating effects of illegal mining on Ghana’s water bodies and environment.  

---

## 🌍 Project Overview
I designed **four interactive Power BI dashboards** that explored the environmental, health, and socio-economic impact of illegal mining (“galamsey”) across Ghana. The visualizations used real environmental data to uncover patterns in **water quality, community health, and ecosystem degradation.**

---

## 🔍 What I Did
1️⃣ Developed **4 Power BI dashboards** presenting trends in water pollution, environmental degradation, and community impact.  
2️⃣ Analyzed **5 key environmental indicators** to provide actionable insights.  
3️⃣ Highlighted the **correlation between mining activity and health outcomes.**  
4️⃣ Presented **policy recommendations** for sustainable, data-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 Tools & Skills
**Tools:** Power BI, Excel  
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Dashboard Design, Data Visualization, Storytelling with Data, Environmental Analytics  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Water quality** worsens significantly in regions with high mining activity.  
- **Communities near mining zones** experience higher health risks and reduced access to clean water.  
- Visual storytelling can drive **policy awareness and accountability** in environmental management.
